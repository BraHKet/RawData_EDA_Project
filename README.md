## Project Overview

This repository presents a data analysis project, focusing on a raw and challenging dataset from Kaggle. The primary objective is to demonstrate a structured approach to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning, transforming an initial messy dataset into a clean, insightful foundation for potential future machine learning models.

The dataset used is: 
[**Raw Data**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aesophor/raw-data/code) - *Note: This dataset was chosen specifically for its raw and uncleaned nature.*

## Methodology

My approach to this project is guided by a systematic EDA process designed to extract maximum value from challenging datasets. The detailed methodological steps are fully documented in the **[Metodology](EDA_Methodology.md)** file.
